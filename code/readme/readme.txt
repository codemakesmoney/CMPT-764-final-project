1.Our project can only be run on Windows, cause we need to handle .skp models and sketchup only have libs on windows.

2.Make sure opengl, glut and glui is available on the computer

3.The .lib and .dll is stored in folder slapi, the header of slapi is stored in folder headers.

4.The sample model "Washington_National_Cathedral.skp" is given in this folder, the height of this mesh is about 4000.

5.When running these two program, you need to press button "open", and enter the path of the .skp model in terminal. (Example: Washington_National_Cathedral.skp)

6.When test the new algorithm, (H = 500, error = 8000), (H = 300, error = 5000) can give a related better result, while you can try others.
